# Hyper CA
Hyper CA is a command line application for simulating *2d binary totalistic cellular automata*, such as Conway's Game of Life. It uses fast 2D convolution to outperform many other implementations. This method is especially efficient for large neighborhood sizes, such as the amazingly lifelike Bugs, a [Larger Than Life] model(http://www.emis.de/journals/DMTCS/pdfpapers/dmAA0113.pdf).
